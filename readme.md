# Startup Challenge

Have you ever watched _Shark Tank_ or **The Pitch**?
Well not only will you create the startup, but now you will tell us what the website for that startup would be.

**Objective:** Each squad will conceptualize a web app startup idea, focusing on a unique problem-solving approach. They will not build the app but will prepare a comprehensive presentation of their idea.

**Duration:** 3 hours

## Phase 1: Problem Identification & Research (45 minutes)

**Brainstorming Session (15 minutes):** Each squad brainstorms problems they encounter in daily life or areas where they think technology can make a difference. Encourage them to think broadly - education, health, environment, entertainment, etc.

**Market Research (30 minutes):** Squads use the internet to research if their identified problem already has existing solutions. They should note what current solutions lack and how their idea can fill that gap.

## Phase 2: Concept Development (1 hour)

**App Conceptualization:** Squads define their app idea, focusing on:

- What it does.
- How it stands out from existing solutions.
- Target audience.

**User Personas Creation:** Develop 2-3 user personas that represent their app's target audience. Each persona should include demographics, interests, and why the app is beneficial for them.

## Phase 3: Planning & Design (45 minutes)

**User Stories:** Write 5-7 user stories that describe how different personas would interact with the app. These should be specific scenarios.

**Wireframe Creation:** Sketch basic wireframes for the app’s main interfaces. They can use tools like Balsamiq, or simple pen and paper. Focus on user flow and key features. (if you use paper, please take a snapshot and upload to a computer)

Here are some tools that you possibly could use:

- [UI/UX Resources](https://github.com/10-3-pursuit/10-3-resources/blob/main/user-experience.md)

- [UX Tools](https://github.com/10-3-pursuit/10-3-resources/blob/main/ux-tools.md)

- [Design Tools](https://github.com/10-3-pursuit/10-3-resources/tree/main/project-tools)

## Phase 4: Presentation Preparation (30 minutes)

**Pitch Development:** Each squad prepares a 5-minute pitch presentation. They should include:

- Problem and solution.
- Target audience and user personas.
- Key features and user stories.
- Wireframes of the app.
- Why their app could be successful in the market.

**Rehearsal:** Quick run-through of their presentation to ensure it's within the time limit.

## Final Phase: Presentations

Each squad has 5 minutes to present their startup idea to the class

Tell us:

- the name of the product
- the persona(s), i.e. who are you solving this problem for? e.g. "Jon is a student who can't afford to go to college. They need a way to find scholarship options for which they are elgible"
- what problem the product solves
- how you differentiate yourselves from other products
- user stories, what will the user be able to do, specifically with the app.

You can show us lo-fi, med-fi, hi-fi mockups, wireframes,logos, palettes, fonts and/or any other deliverables you choose. You could even do an HTML, CSS mockup, but coding is not at all required.

As many people as possible in your squad should have a chance to speak.

Good Luck!

# Startup Challenge

**Objective:** Each squad will conceptualize a web app startup idea, focusing on a unique problem-solving approach. They will not build the app but will prepare a comprehensive presentation of their idea.

**Duration:** 3 hours

## Phase 1: Problem Identification & Research (45 minutes)

**Brainstorming Session (15 minutes):** Each squad brainstorms problems they encounter in daily life or areas where they think technology can make a difference. Encourage them to think broadly - education, health, environment, entertainment, etc.

**Market Research (30 minutes):** squads use the internet to research if their identified problem already has existing solutions. They should note what current solutions lack and how their idea can fill that gap.

## Phase 2: Concept Development (1 hour)

**App Conceptualization:** squads define their app idea, focusing on:

- What it does.
- How it stands out from existing solutions.
- Target audience.

**User Personas Creation:** Develop 2-3 user personas that represent their app's target audience. Each persona should include demographics, interests, and why the app is beneficial for them.

## Phase 3: Planning & Design (45 minutes)

**User Stories:** Write 5-7 user stories that describe how different personas would interact with the app. These should be specific scenarios.

**Wireframe Creation:** Sketch basic wireframes for the appâ€™s main interfaces. They can use tools like Balsamiq, or simple pen and paper. Focus on user flow and key features.

## Phase 4: Presentation Preparation (30 minutes)

**Pitch Development:** Each squad prepares a 5-minute pitch presentation. They should include:

- Problem and solution.
- Target audience and user personas.
- Key features and user stories.
- Wireframes of the app.
- Why their app could be successful in the market.

**Rehearsal:** Quick run-through of their presentation to ensure it's within the time limit.

## Final Phase: Presentations

Each squad presents their startup idea to the class.
Encourage other squads to ask questions and give feedback.
